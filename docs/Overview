/*****OVERVIEW*****\
The Salary Guide is a javascript web app that runs on Node, Express, Angular, and Postgresql. This file is an overview of
all these parts and how they work together. Since Salary Guide is javascript on both the front and back end it would be helpful
if you are familiar with javascript. Check out these books: http://it-ebooks.info/book/274/ and http://it-ebooks.info/book/4712/

NODE
Node is a javascript runtime environment that allows you to use javascript outside of the browser. Unlike browser javascript
it has access to the file system. This allows it to access databases and to read from and create files. To learn more about node,
I recommend this book: http://it-ebooks.info/book/830/

EXPRESS
Express is a node module that helps by making it simpler to create an HTTP server. I recommend you check out these two books
for help on express: http://it-ebooks.info/book/4688/ and http://it-ebooks.info/book/4687/

ANGULAR
Angular is a frontend javascript framework for single page apps. It's really fuckin complex and takes a lot of time to learn. If you know javascript,
you should be able to understand what I've done in Angular by reading the comments in the code. If you want more info, I
recommend this book: https://www.ng-book.com/

POSTGRES
Postgres is an open source database. It can be difficult to administer but it is fast, reliable, and cutting edge. I haven't
found any GREAT postgres books but I recommend you check out the tutorial in the documentation on the website.

/*****HOW IT WORKS*****\
Here's a quick run-through of the system:
1. We get salary data from the university.
2. We clean the data and store it in postgres.
3. We use node and express to host the webserver and connect it to the database.
4. Build the system by running "gulp dev" in the command line.
5. When a client connects to the site they are sent the entire app and all of the site content structured via angular.
6. When the client searches someone, that request is sent to an endpoint on our API which queries postgres and sends back the response.
